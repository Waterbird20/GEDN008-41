Not only are ants impressively strong, they are also amazing team players.  This research inspired by such teamwork examples how the ways that microrobots move effects their ability to work in teams.[4]

A 1800 kg automobile is pulled by a team of 6 µTug robots on a concrete floor with load sharing for a combined force of 200 N.1

He most likely would have been surprised to learn that a team of six microrobots, weighing just 3.5 ounces in total, could pull a car weighing 3,900 pounds.[3]

It is done by Biomimetics&Dexterous Maipulation Lab[2]

Find new "meta-material"

If we think of the bird-nest material as a bunch of sticks that are just jammed together, which to some very crude degree is accurate, then as a material it would fall somewhere in the spectrum between sand and cotton.[5]
